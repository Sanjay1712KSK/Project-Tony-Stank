# LLLMao - Local Large Language Model Assistant Orchestrator v1 - Work in progress

Linux-native Local AI Workstation Platform

LLLMao is a local-first AI workstation platform designed for Linux power users, developers, researchers, and workstation environments.

Built around Ollama and a native Tauri desktop runtime, LLLMao combines multimodal AI interaction, workspace-aware retrieval, telemetry, orchestration-aware runtime management, and offline-first workflows into a single desktop experience.

# Installation

## Requirements

Recommended:

* Ubuntu 24.04+
* NVIDIA GPU
* Ollama installed locally
* 16GB+ RAM
* SSD storage for model/runtime workloads

---

## Install Ollama

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

Start Ollama:

```bash
ollama serve
```

Pull a model:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
```

---

# Development

## Backend

```bash
cd backend

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

---

## Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

pnpm install

pnpm tauri dev
```

---

# Snap Package

LLLMao is being prepared for Snap distribution and Ubuntu App Center deployment.

Current builds are experimental beta builds.

---

# Planned Areas of Improvement

* Runtime stability
* Better onboarding
* Improved voice interaction reliability
* More resilient orchestration
* Expanded multimodal workflows
* AppImage + DEB packaging
* Advanced workspace tooling
* Multi-agent systems
* Better Linux environment compatibility
* Improved diagnostics and recovery tooling

---

# Philosophy

LLLMao is designed around:

* local-first AI
* Linux-native workflows
* developer-oriented ergonomics
* offline capability
* workstation-grade runtime visibility
* orchestration-aware resource management

The goal is not simply to provide a chat interface, but to evolve toward a full local AI workstation environment.

# Warning

This project is currently experimental.

Do not rely on it for:

* production-critical workflows
* sensitive enterprise deployments
* unattended runtime environments

Always validate outputs and maintain backups of important data.
